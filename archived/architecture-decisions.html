<h3 id="golang">Golang</h3>
<p>Golang is a highly concurrent and extremely simple language to learn and understand.
There is no need to learn complicated frameworks and provides everything one
needs to create a web application backend, there are also a lot of language
concepts included by default with the language, like the standard library's
<code>net/http</code> module, and excellent support for modern standards.</p>
<p>The other thing is, I wanted to learn more about the language, as I already have
experience with C#, Java, Python, JavaScript when it comes to web development,
and this feels like a great opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="svelte">Svelte</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Svelte is the framework that best meets the API of the web. It does it’sbest
to adhere to standard, and really only builds on what exists, doesn’tinvent
anything new like JSX.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because Svelte follows the web’s lead, learning Svelte is
super easy. There are no non-standard syntax features, like JSX, and
inconsistencies in doing things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>React functional components</li>
<li>React class components</li>
<li>old class hooks</li>
<li>functional hooks</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance is rock solid—Svelte is often beating out other frameworkson
UI and JS speed. And it’s increasingly used in production on various
popular and traction-heavy sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the “disappearing framework.” This feature is probably Svelte’s greatest
innovation, and every framework should (and many are trying to) adopt this
idea. There are zero client-side dependencies. Just the end JS of the
component itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The core part of the application revolves around receiving code from a user,
running it with a specific input, and checking the outcome. If the outcome is
satisfactory - test passed, otherwise - test failed.</p>
<p>Now, what is the current workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application receives a submission that has the user's code.</li>
<li>The application fetches all the test cases for the given exercise.</li>
<li>For every test case, a request is sent to the code execution segment, which
runs the piece of code, and returns a result to the &quot;backend&quot;.</li>
<li>When a run is complete, the &quot;backend&quot; checks the &quot;output&quot; of that piece of
code, and the predefined by that test &quot;output&quot;, and if they match, then the
test was passed. If there was a runtime error, then the test is automatically
failed.</li>
<li>When all tests have been ran, the results are saved in the database, and
returned to the frontend.</li>
</ul>
